### Issues with Project

#### Expected Behavior

When I clck the reset buttoon while the clock is running it should be stopped and the break-length, session-length and time left should return to their default values, 5, 25, 25, respectively.

#### Actual Behavior

When I clck the reset button while the clock is running, the clock temporarily reverts back to default values.
However, after a second or so goes right back to where the countdown was before it displayed default values.
